# engine-vibration-notebook
[A small test](https://github.com/alfredocarella/engine-vibration-notebook/blob/master/Torsional_vibration_measurements.ipynb) in order to get some familiarity with Jupyter notebooks.

* The start point is a time series of raw cylinder pressure data (pressure vs. time) for a 4-stroke engine
* The output after a frequency domain analysis is a table showing the relative amplitude of the harmonic components in the engine torque.
